# Data Structures Implementation: 

The following directory will contain some data structures implemented using several programming languages (mainly Python), please consider the following:

- **Built-in Data Structures**: in Python; there are various built-in data structures: **Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets**; others such as **DataFrame** are living at some packages like **pandas** and **numpy**, others like arrays (which is found at numpy) are available in some programming languages like C, C++ and others, however all those built-in data structures will not be implemented here, they will be used to implement other data structures and algorithms, to learn more about these, please visit [Python's official documentation](https://www.python.org/documentation).

- **Abstract Data Types (ADTs)**: **abstraction** is an important concept when it comes to programming, it defines complex systems in term of their core functions, it hides the inner-working, with this absolutely amazing concept in mind; we'll use **ADTs** to implement various algorithms, those **ADTs** will be implemented here in this directory.
